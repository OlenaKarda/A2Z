						responsible for taking precautions and providing security measures best suited for your situation and

						Personal Information collected via our Web Sites, due to the inherent nature of the Internet as an
						open global communications vehicle, we cannot guarantee that any information, during transmission
						through the Internet or while stored on our system or otherwise in our care, will be absolutely safe
						from intrusion by others, such as hackers. If you contact us by e-mail or a "contact us" or similar
						feature on our Web Sites, you should be aware that your transmission might not be secure. A third
						party could view information you send by these methods in transit. We will have no liability for
						disclosure of your information due to errors or unauthorized acts of third parties during or after
						transmission. In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your Personal Information in
						our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If
						a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the
						circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail. You
						consent to our use of e-mail as a means of such notification.
						<br>Phishing
						<br>With identity theft a
						continuing problem, it has become increasingly common for unauthorized individuals to send e-mail
						messages to consumers, purporting to represent a legitimate company such as a bank or on-line
						merchant, requesting that the consumer provide personal, often sensitive information. Sometimes, the
						domain name of the e-mail address from which the e-mail appears to have been sent, and the domain name
						of the web site requesting such information, appears to be the domain name of a legitimate, trusted
						company. In reality, such sensitive information is received by an unauthorized individual to be used
						for purposes of identity theft. This illegal activity has come to be known as "phishing." If you
						receive an e-mail or other correspondence requesting that you provide any sensitive information
						(including any password or credit card information) via e-mail or to a web site that does not seem to
						be affiliated with our Web Sites, or that otherwise seems suspicious to you, please do not provide
						such information, and report such request to us at www.A2ZParts.com
						<br>Changes to this Privacy Policy<br>
						Wereserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time, and such changes will be effective
						immediately upon posting to the Web Site(s). Under certain circumstances (for example, in connection
						with certain material changes), we may also elect to notify you of changes or updates to our Privacy
						Policy by additional means, such as posting a notice on the front page of our Web Site(s) or sending
						you an e-mail.
